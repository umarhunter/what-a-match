<p>Boehmer & Heeger's paper introduces the problem of adapting stable matchings to forced and forbidden pairs within the
    context of classical stable matching settings, including Stable Roommates and Stable Marriage with ties. The goal is
    to find a stable matching that incorporates a given stable matching (M1), forced pairs (Q), and avoids forbidden
    pairs (P). The paper presents a polynomial-time algorithm based on the theory of rotations for adapting Stable
    Roommates matchings to forced pairs. It demonstrates that addressing forbidden pairs is NP-hard, but extends the
    polynomial-time algorithm to a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm when both forced and forbidden pairs are present.
    <br><br>
    The study also explores the impact of preferences containing ties, revealing that algorithmic results may be
    extended or that formerly tractable problems become intractable, depending on the chosen stability criterion.</p>
