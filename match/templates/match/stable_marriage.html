<p> Gale and Shapley's stable matching algorithm addresses the
    problem of forming stable pairs in situations where individuals have preferences over one another.
    The algorithm proceeds through a series of rounds, where each unengaged individual proposes to their most preferred
    available partner, and each engaged individual holds on to the best proposal received. This process iterates until no further
    improvements are possible. The resulting matchings are stable because, at the end,
    no individual has an incentive to break their current pairing for an alternative one.
    This algorithm has widespread applications, from matchmaking in dating platforms to solving complex scenarios like
    job placements, where maintaining stability and fairness in partnerships is crucial.</p>
