<p> Gale and Shapley's stable matching algorithm is a groundbreaking method that addresses the
    problem of forming stable pairs in situations where individuals have preferences over one another.
    The algorithm proceeds through a series of rounds, where each unengaged individual proposes to their most preferred available partner,
    and each engaged individual holds on to the best proposal received. This process iterates until no further improvements are possible. The resulting matchings are stable because, at the end,
    no individual has an incentive to break their current pairing for an alternative one.
    This algorithm has widespread applications, from matchmaking in dating platforms to solving complex scenarios like job placements, where maintaining stability and fairness in partnerships is crucial.</p>
