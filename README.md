# what-a-match
This project incorporates Gale-Shapley's (1962) and Irving's (1985) algorithms for Stable Matching and Stable Roommate (respectively). This project was created as a final project for Hunter College's **CSCI49387: Distributed Artificial Intelligence**. 

A long term goal is to also incorporate Niclas Boehmer & Klaus Heeger's paper "Adapting Stable Matchings to Forced and Forbidden Pairs" [[AAMAS 2023]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10040) on adapting our matches as the scenarios shift.
